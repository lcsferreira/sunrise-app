## Overview

SunSync is a React-based web application that provides information about sunrise, sunset, and other relevant details based on the user's selected location and date. The app utilizes the SunriseSunset API to fetch accurate sunrise and sunset data. Users can choose a specific date, country, state, and city to get personalized information about the sun's position and daylight duration.

## Features

- **Date Selection**: Users can pick a specific date to get sunrise and sunset information for that day.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: The app dynamically changes the background image based on the time of day (sunrise, midday, sunset).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The app is built using the React library for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **axios**: Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the SunriseSunset API.
- **react-responsive-carousel**: The carousel library is used to display information about different times of the day in a visually appealing manner.
